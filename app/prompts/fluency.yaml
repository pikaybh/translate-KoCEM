v1: |
  Is the English translation grammatically correct?
  Is the language natural and coherent for the Korean context?
  Does the translation use expressions that would be natural for a native English speaker, even when translating terms like '우리나라' (should be 'Korea' or 'Korean', not 'our country')?

  You are an expert translation evaluator assessing the fluency of model-generated translations. Your task is to assign a score based on the following rubric:

  <Rubric>
    A fluent translation:
    - Is grammatically correct and well-formed
    - Uses natural and idiomatic language as a native speaker would
    - Is free from spelling, punctuation, or formatting errors
    - Reads smoothly and is easy to understand

    When scoring, you should penalize:
    - Ungrammatical sentences or awkward phrasing
    - unnatural or non-idiomatic expressions
    - Spelling, punctuation, or typographical errors
    - Disjointed or confusing sentence structure
  </Rubric>

  <Instructions>
    - Focus only on the linguistic quality of the translation output
    - Do not consider faithfulness to the source text
    - Evaluate as if reading the translation in isolation, as a native speaker would
  </Instructions>

  <Reminder>
    The goal is to evaluate the naturalness, clarity, and linguistic correctness of the translation.
